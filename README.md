This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. Choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

* This [visualiser](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer) was a lifesavior to understand what was happening. 
* [J0santos' README](https://github.com/J0Santos/42-push_swap#readme) has cool links at the end and a super good overview of what's required by the subject. 
* However, I went with a merge algorithm more similar to [Mlanca's Push swap project](https://github.com/mlanca-c/push_swap) although I didn't use double linked lists. Her results are more optimised. 
* For your information, [here's Protsaq's project](https://github.com/protsaq/push_swap). I don't recommend to imitate him, especially since he uses arrays of given sizes (500 numbers) but he had amazing results and the logic is super interesting. It's also very cool to learn about LIS algorithms.
